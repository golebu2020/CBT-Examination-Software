# Situation / Motivation
Over the last few years, there has been a migration from the usual manual system of writing tests and examinations, especially public and private examinations, to automated computer-based systems. These examinations include: University Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) - the examination body that helps facilitate the admission of students into higher institutions of learning, Post UTME and even job interview tests usually organized by SHL and Cubik.
No doubts, this CBT System has been adopted to curb the effects of examination malpractice on our nationâ€™s academic framework and to synchronize the frequency of our education with that of the advanced nations of the world.

Since the introduction of the CBT System, research has indicated that over 50% of candidates who write the UTME fail abysmally. This has shown that the number of failures has escalated beyond the usual index recorded during the periods of using the manual systems. Of course, this could be attributed to lack of technical know-how on the side of the students as regards answering questions running on a computer system via a centralized data management server. The difficulties of interacting with the computer system when writing examinations ultimately result from computer illiteracy.

# Computer-Based-Software
An application branded; CBS Pro X1, is an initiative that has been specially and uniquely crafted out by Zwits Technologies Limited based on the prevailing challenges being faced by our educational system. The main motivation behind this ideology is that of curbing the impact of the receding academic standard including increase in the number of years spent by students in seeking for admission and unemployment in the long run due to the late-age-of-graduation syndrome.

# Core features of the System
The CBS Pro X1 application has the following that makes it stand out in the midst of similar existing systems in the market:
1)  It incorporates a system whereby the administration can have a unique password and students or candidates can be registered using their names, surnames, passwords, exam I.D, their passports and examination combination or exam set.
2)  The website of all universities in Nigeria including private and public universities can be visited to check out for information concerning admission status and other related information.
